# Phone Appilication Controlled Robotic Arm
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Second Milestone

My second milestone was creating the code and the design of my android app as well as getting the bluetooth to work with the ESP32. For the application, I worked on the MIT App Developer and designed the outline for the app. The app contains four slides to control the four servo motors on the robotic arm. It also contains a connect and disconnect button to link the bluetooth from the ESP32 to the

# First Milestone

My first milestone was learning the basics about the Arduino, the Arduino IDE, as well as the connecting the servo motors. After I got the basics done, I finihed duiilding the physical components for the Robotic Arm and connected the servos to the arduino.During the process of building the robotic arm, I did not run into a lot of difficualties, however, when I was wiring the servos onto the breadboard, I short-circuited the arduino. After a lot of trial and error, I was finally able yo wire and connect them correctly to the arduino. In addition, I also added an HC-SR04 sensor onto the robotic arm such that it can detects objects that are a certian distance away from it and then pick it up.
